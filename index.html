                    <p>The <span class="article-head"> CanSat </span> program is an educational initiative that involves designing, building, and launching small, simulated satellites called CanSats. These CanSats are often the size and shape of a soda can, containing various sensors and instruments to collect data during a controlled descent back to Earth.</p>
                    <p><span class="article-head">Our mission</span> aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ozone layer's behaviour and the environmental impacts of its depletion or excess. By collecting valuable weather and climate data, this mission contributes to scientific knowledge and provides insights into the consequences of human activities on Earth's climate and air quality. It shall serve as an educational and research initiative to inspire and inform future generations about the importance of preserving our planet. In other words, once our CanSat is show into the air it will start collecting various data by it's sensors. Then it shall come down to the ground using it's recovery system which we are yet to design and at the same time transmit the data that it's collecting to our station on the ground.</p>

                        <h3>Studying ozone holes phenomenon:</h3>
                        <p>Our CanSat mission aims to understand the phenomenon of ozone holes and investigate the harmful effects of excess or depletion of ozone in the ozone layer. In this way, we want to emphasize the importance of protecting the ozone layer for our planet and human health. Through ozone research, we aim to raise awareness on this issue.  </p>

                        <p>Our mission is geared towards providing valuable weather data, such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, which can be integrated with existing weather systems. These data can help improve weather forecasts and provide a better understanding of local atmospheric conditions.</p>

                        <p>With our CanSat, we aim to focus on monitoring climate changes by collecting data over an extended period. Comparing the results of our mission with those from previous years will allow for the analysis of climate changes and the identification of atmospheric trends.</p>

                        <h3>Studying the Levels of Key Greenhouse Gases in the Atmosphere:</h3>
                        <p>Our CanSat mission will concentrate on studying the levels of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Researching these gases will aid in understanding the impact of human activities on climate change and air quality. Through these CanSat mission objectives, we seek to contribute to scientific research, educational efforts, and raising awareness about the importance of environmental protection and the ozone layer.</p>

                    <h3>Adam Strzelczyk</h3>
                    <h4>Teacher/manager</h4>
                    <p>First of all, we should probably introduce our teacher who helped us form our team and also manages the meetings that we have during school time. His name is Adam Strzelczyk. By profession he is a computer science and math teacher. However, that's not all. He's also a physicist, but it's more of a hobby. He dedicates his free time to spreading knowledge amongst students. He's the head of our school's astronomy club</p>

                    <h3>Krzysztof Bajda</h3>
                    <h4>Leader/Mechanics/designer</h4>
                    <p>Our leader Krzysztof Bajda, currently is a student in the 3rd grade of high school taking mathematics and physics as his A level subjects. Ever since he unwrapped his first LEGO set as a child, his fascination with creating intricate mechanical systems ignited a lifelong passion. His role in the team is crucial. He's the one responsible for designing our CanSat to make sure that every one of the systems that we want to include are in place. On average, he sacrifices 5 to 6 hours weekly to working on our plan.</p>

                    <h3>Paweł Dłubała</h3>
                    <h4>Electronics/programmer</h4>
                    <p>His current field of study is also computer science. It's important to mention that he's very well rounded. Not only is he a great technician but also a musician who plays in a band. He's a very talented individual whose passion for programming has been burning for the past 4 years (that is when he started high school). With his curiosity and knack for problem solving he has embarked on a journey into the world of coding and programming. Due to his very busy schedule it would seem that he couldn't ever make time to take part in such project, however his ambition proved that anything is possible. He dedicates 3 hours of his time weekly to help our team with our scheme. Ever since he took interest in that field he has been constantly expanding his skills, which is why he decided to join our team and popularise knowledge with the help of this project</p>

                    <h3>Rafał Malinowski</h3>
                    <h4>Programmer/electronics</h4>
                    <p>Rafał as his major decided to take computer science (specifically information technology). He took interest in physics and astronomy since he can remember and also programming and algorithmics since he was 12. Currently, he is studying IT and automation. About the time that he dedicates weekly into working on the project it ranges between 5 to 10 hours at home and about 2 hours at school. Regarding his role in the team, he's mainly responsible for programming microelements as well as electronics.</p>

                    <h3>Maja Goyk</h3>
                    <h4>Writer/organisator</h4>
                    <p>She's a student in the 2nd grade who chose mathematics and physics as her A level subjects just like the majority of the team members. She's very passionate about physics- especially about astrophysics. That interest started when she got her first toy telescope as a child. She decided to take part in the project not only because it's especially interesting but also because she wants to prove that women in STEM can achieve any goal that they set their mind on. Regarding her role in the team she's responsible for writing and editing all sorts of reports (just like this PDR). Maja also help with coordinating the direction of work as well as analysing data that the rest of the team previously collected. Regarding her weekly time input it ranged between 5 to 6 hours at home and about 1 to 2 hours at school.</p>

                    <h3>Dominik Kostecki</h3>
                    <h4>Math/computations</h4>
                    <p>Dominik Kostecki, who is also a student in the 3rd grade of high school with math and physics as his major. He had always been a math enthusiast which is exactly why he deals with any obligatory computations that'd need to be solved throughout the project. He's also very invested in science, specifically in astronomy and quantum physics. He dedicates around 6-8 hours weekly to working on our project at home and 2 to 3 hours at school when meeting the other members of the team in person.</p>
